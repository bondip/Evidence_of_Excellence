### Continuous Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitor
- 4th year Engineering Design Project
  - Designed the glucose concentration detection algorithm, optics, and mechanical assembly
 
### Miniaturized Fluorescence Microscope
- Masters of Applied Sciences Contracted Project
  - Designed the electronics, optics, microfluidic device, and mechanical assembly for a miniaturized fluorescence microscope used by the local hospital to quantify the concentration of free DNA in patient blood samples as a flag for severe sepsis.

## Parker's personal projects
### Bluetooth wearable
- Designed the electronics, firmware, mechanical, and algorithm necessary for battery powered wearable technology bluetooth enabled sensors.

### Home renovation
- Purchased a fix-er-upper house and renovated it. Making professional grade cabinetry, stairs, tables, plumbing, electrical, etc.

## Career projects
### Current Employer
- Decreased time to complete main PCB by introducing the team to an interposer board solution instead of re-designing the entire PCB.

### Previous Employer
- Ideated and created Graphical User Interface (GUI) for automatic control of the LED power according to skin type for heart rate sensor. Improved product performance and decreased product development timeline by increasing testing speed and accuracy.
- Designed the digital/analog electronics, mechanics, and firmware for a revolutionary AI Core Body Temperature product.
